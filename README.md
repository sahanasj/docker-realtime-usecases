## 1. Dockerize A Simple Web-Application Created By Using Python, Flask and PostgreSQL (IMP)
How to create a Python web-application using Flask and PostgreSQL server, and run it in Docker virtualization platform environment!

- Install and configure Docker’s virtualization platform on a host machine;
- Migrate the existing Python web application, introduced in this article, to Docker virtualization environment by creating separate Docker container;
